# Solution to Algebra Chapter 0
**Download Here**: [Solution to Algebra, Chapter 0.pdf](https://github.com/hooyuser/Solution-to-Algebra-Chapter-0/releases/latest/download/Solution_to_Algebra_Chapter_0.pdf)

This is a solution manual for *ALGEBRA, Chapter 0*, an algebra textbook written by Paolo Aluffi. 
The way of introducing abstract algebra in a language of categories appeals to me very much.
So I'm willing to share my solutions to the exercises in this book. 

As a beginner, I'm trying to make my proof explict and detailed, but unfortunately it seems verbose and tedious sometimes. 
Anyway, I would appreciate it if you can point out my mistakes, big or small.
